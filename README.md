## Overview

The goal of this project is to have codes for various data structures and algorithms - in C, C++, Java and Python. 
Feel free to contribute in any way you want.
Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.

## Contents

We currently have 4 folders for 4 programming languages - C, C++, Java, Python
**Do not create folders in your submissions, unless specifically told to do so.**

## Contributing Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a _first come, first serve_ basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in C-Plus-Plus, it goes inside the C-Plus-Plus folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding _README.md_ file to **add the link to your code in the corresponding section** ([GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
- Also, be polite with the reviewers - they will be ALWAYS polite to you.
